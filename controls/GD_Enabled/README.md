## Control Description
GuardDuty is enabled for in-scope regions.

## Required Evidence
* [all_detectors.json](/evidence_library/CloudTrail/regions/us-east-1/all_detectors.json) provides a list of detectors in a specific region.
  * This evidence is gathered by calling the [list_detectors()](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.26.89/reference/services/guardduty/client/list_detectors.html) command in Boto 3.
* [DETECTOR_ID_config.json](/evidence_library/CloudTrail/regions/us-east-1/DETECTOR_ID_config.json) provides information on the configuration of each detector.
  * This evidence is gathered by calling the [get_detectors()](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.26.89/reference/services/guardduty/client/get_detector.html) command in Boto 3.

## Testing Details
1. For each in-scope region, review the [DETECTOR_ID_config.json](/evidence_library/CloudTrail/regions/us-east-1/DETECTOR_ID_config.json) file and confirm the following:
    * Confirm the "Status" is enabled at the detector level.
    * **Note:** It is your responsiblity to determine which regions are in-scope. At a minimum, you should include any region with an AWS resource (S3, RDS, EC2, etc).
