# About
This playbook was written by [AJ Dehn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajdehn/). The goal of this project is to help auditors conduct **AWS audits, without screenshots**.

# Summary
To accomplish this vision, we are building the following:
- A [script](./gatherAwsEvidence.py) to generate JSON files directly from AWS (no screenshots required).
- A [library](./controls/) of audit evidence with example JSON files.
- List of [controls](./controls/) with detailed guidance of how to test each control.
- An example [audit workpaper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bGfbXUTSzVCSGCWn7UtG6QN4wWeEKdrubygcCuDDjbI/edit?usp=sharing) to document audit results.

With your help, we hope that screenshots of AWS will be extinct by **12/31/2026**.
